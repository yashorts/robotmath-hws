# linear-transformations-and-compositions

## description
- Few problems on linear transformations and its compositions, lastest-frame vs initial-frame based rotations.
- And crisp solutions to them.

## roadmap
- Problems given in `2020_hw1.pdf` are solved.

## code
- Solutions are written in Latex in `hw1.tex`.

## usage
- Use any Latex compiler to compile solutions tex file into pdf.
- `latekmk` is a good one.
