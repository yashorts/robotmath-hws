# jacobian-of-end-effector

## description
- Few problems on finding Jacobian of the pose of end effector as a function of joint variables.
- And crisp solutions to them.

## roadmap
- Problems given in `2020_hw4.pdf` are solved.

## code
- Solutions are written in Latex in `hw4.tex`.

## usage
- Use any Latex compiler to compile solutions tex file into pdf.
- `latekmk` is a good one.
