# dh-frame-hopping-convention

## description
- Few problems on DH frame hopping for forward kinematics in joined links.
- And crisp solutions to them.

## roadmap
- Problems given in `2020_hw3.pdf` are solved.

## code
- Solutions are written in Latex in `hw3.tex`.

## usage
- Use any Latex compiler to compile solutions tex file into pdf.
- `latekmk` is a good one.
